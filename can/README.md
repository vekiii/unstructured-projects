CAN Communication – C8051F500

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of CAN (Controller Area Network) communication using the C8051F500 development system. The project was developed and presented as a team effort, focusing on both theoretical understanding and practical application of CAN-based communication.

Project Overview

The project covers the following key aspects:

Introduction to CAN communication
Explanation of CAN usage, its advantages, and reasons why it is widely used in industrial and automotive systems.

Theoretical background
Description of the signal flow from the CAN transmitter through the CAN bus to the receiver and output devices.

Practical implementation
Two C8051F500 boards communicate with each other via CAN. A switch on one board controls an LED on the other board, and vice versa, demonstrating bidirectional communication over the CAN bus.

Key Features

CAN-based device-to-device communication

Real-time signal transmission

Simple and clear demonstration of CAN principles

Suitable for educational and introductory CAN projects

This project serves as a solid foundation for understanding CAN communication and its application in embedded and industrial systems.
