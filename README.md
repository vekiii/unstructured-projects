# unstructured-projects

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of **unstructured and miscellaneous projects** that do not belong to a single, well-defined domain or industry. It is intended as a flexible workspace for experimenting with different technologies, ideas, and concepts.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to store:
- Experimental and exploratory projects  
- Small-scale prototypes and proofs of concept  
- Academic or personal exercises  
- One-off implementations that do not fit into other specialized repositories  

## Project Structure
Each project is stored in its own directory and may include:
- Source code
- Documentation or reports
- Diagrams, simulations, or configuration files
- Notes related to development or testing

Projects inside this repository are **independent of one another** and may vary significantly in scope, technology stack, and maturity.

## Technologies
Projects may involve, but are not limited to:
- Embedded systems
- PLC / SCADA concepts
- Software development
- Automation and control systems
- Communication protocols
- Simulation and academic experiments

## Notes
This repository is intentionally unstructured.  
Project quality, completeness, and documentation may vary depending on the purpose of each individual project.

## License
This repository is intended for educational and demonstration purposes unless stated otherwise in individual project folders.
